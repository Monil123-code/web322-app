                     Hello everyone, my name is Monil Patel. I am currently persuing my diploma degree in computer programming at Seneca College. Also, I am interested in robotics and wanted to developing something but I haven't figured it out. I am also interested in spirituality, like knowing about
                      myself what I am from where do I come from and what happens after death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           My journey towards spirituality started when I saw someone die for the very first time. I was so curoius that what was it what will happen now and where does he/she goes after death. I asked my parents a lot of questions and 
                           fortunately I was blessed enough to get some of the answers. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           I am still actively practicing spirituality. By connecting to a very well organization which is spread world-wide. Which has its roots back in my home country India. Which is also often called the land of Gods.
                        </p>
